# External contracts

All contracts in this folder were originally copied from a `core/contracts/oracle` and any changes are documented in the `CHANGELOG.md`.

One blanket change for all contracts is changing the path for any imported contracts (i.e. `@openzeppelin`, `@uniswap`, etc.) to the copied contract in `optimism/external/`.
